The Lilt library provides tools for building complex SC applications out of modules called "Scripts". A Script holds SuperCollider code just as a workspace window, but offers additional features such as making its own GUI for starting and stopping the main process that belongs to the Script such as a Synth, a Group or a Routine and for controlling parameters, linking of audio and control busses to other Scripts, and MIDI control. An application made out of a group of Scripts can be saved as a "Session". A Session is itself a script that creates all the scripts used by the session and configures their connections, settings, audio buffers and MIDI.

Additionally, Lilt provides facilities for creating GUI's easily and for managing resources and configurations such as synthdefs, audio samples, audio and control busses and MIDI. 

Installing Lilt is easy: Just copy the Lilt folder into the SCClassLibrary folder and recompile SC Lang (Client) with Command-K.  No changes are made that affect compatibility to other parts of SC Lang. 

To get started: 
- Read the file LILT_QUICK_START
- See documentation in folder Lilt/Scripts/About Scripts

SHORT GUIDE TO INSTALLING AND USING LILT

- Put the Lilt library in the SCClassLibrary folder and re-compile SC.

- Evaluate this expression: 
	ScriptBrowser.startup;

- A small window named "Browsers" will appear to the right of the server windows. Also a Script-Browser window will open on the left upper part of the screen. 

- The first folder on the Script-Browser folder list contains documentation for this library. The other folders contain further documentation and examples. 

- Each of the remaining 4 buttons on the "Browsers" window opens a different type of browser: 

 --Sessions: This is a system for saving and loading script configurations as a script. (Under development)

 --Samples: Browser for loading groups of sound files from disc, and using these with scripts. 

 --Synthdefs: Browser for managing synthdef files, and creating default scripts for them automatically.

 --MIDI: Browser for displaying received MIDI messages and assigning these to a midi configuration.

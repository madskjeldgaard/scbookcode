The Lilt/Script library provides features that facilitate the definition, control and interconnection of Synths, Groups, Patterns, Events, audio Buffers and processes that react to changes happening in other objects. Some of these features are: 

-	Automatic generation of a GUI for starting and stopping of Scripts, 
	including display of the Scripts active-status (running / stopped).
-	Automatic generation of a GUI for controlling a scripts parameters
	based on specifications written in the script.
-	Automatic generation of Script code from SynthDescs of loaded SynthDefs.
-	Connection of a Script's output to another Script's inputs via drag-and-drop.
	This takes care of bus allocation and starting of Scripts so that the signal 
	output of a Script's Synth(s) is read by the input of another Script's Synth(s). 
-	Allocation of buffer numbers to the buffer input of a Script's synth 
	by selection from a menu in the parameter's gui, which is updated automatically
	when new sound files are loaded to RAM or deleted from it.  
-	Loading and control of Scripts via OSC commands.
-	A window for browsing script files from a folder and its subfolders, including 
     a simple editor for editing the selected Script, commands testing Scripts 
     and loading of scripts to a patch GUI via drag-and-drop. 
-	A window for browsing SynthDef code files from a folder and its subfolders, with display of 
     SynthDefs controls and automatic generation Script code from the selected SynthDef.
-	A window for managing buffers loaded from sound files. 
-	Automatic binding of incoming MIDI messages to controls via a "learn mode" and saving 
    of these in Session scipts. 
-	Saving and loading of groups of Script instances as well as their current links, 
    parameters, snapshots and midi-settings, in the form of Scripts that create Sessions. 

Documentation about using Script is contained in Lilt/Scripts/About Scripts/ and can be browsed by the Scripts browser.  To open a Scripts browser do:
